Yi Wang joined the School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School at Shenzhen University in June 2017. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision by Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng.

Yi Wang's research interests mainly focus on Intelligent Computing Assisted Diagnosis and Interventions (especially in medical image registration, multi-modality prostate image analysis, computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis, and intelligent orthopedics). Dr. Wang has published several papers in the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (TCYB), International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), and so on. Dr. Wang keeps good relationship with clinic and various research groups, and values practical techniques that can be transferred to clinically applicable systems.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
