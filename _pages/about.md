Yi Wang joined the School of Biomedical Engineering, Medical School at Shenzhen University in June 2017. He received his Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision by [Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/).

Yi Wang's research interests mainly focus on Intelligent Computing Assisted Diagnosis and Interventions (especially in medical image registration, multi-modality prostate image analysis, computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis, and intelligent orthopedics). Dr. Wang has published several papers in the _IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging_ (TMI), _IEEE Transactions on Image Processing_ (TIP), _IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics_ (TCYB), _International Conference on Computer Vision_ (ICCV), _International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention_ (MICCAI), and so on. Dr. Wang keeps good relationship with clinic and various research groups, and values practical techniques that can be transferred to clinically applicable systems.
